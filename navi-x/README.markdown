Note 5: The support for subtitles should be easy to use by anyone. In addition to the other information you may provide in a plx file, to add a subtitle 
(you have no limits in the number of subtitles) type like the following:

subtitle.<title of subtitle>=<link to subtitle>

for example:

subtitle.pt=http://example.com

Note 6: These features work only in the Showtime Plugin Navi-X, there's not support for those features in any other platform, including XBMC and Boxee.

## FAQ
### 1. Live Streams from playlists are supported in Showtime?
Yes they are, but they should be in rtmp protocol, there is no support for mms or http live streaming in Showtime. You can watch even TV Channels added from other Navi-X user but I'll 
not tell you where, search Navi-X and you might find it.

### 2. There are some sections that says "XBMC Only", I can't use them in Showtime?
Some of them you can, those entries are labelled like that because the videos contained in those playlists are rtmp link, that XBMC supports while other platforms can't support, 
but Showtime supports it and you can use it as well, you're free to navigate these playlists.

### 3. There are some sections that says "Boxee Only", I can't use them in Showtime?
During development, I faced myself with some playlists labelled like these and some of them didn't work since the feature behind that makes the playlist only supportable for Boxee 
is the HTML support that Showtime can't support, you might try these playlists but most possibly the plugin will not be able to get you the playlist, in these cases you'll get an empty 
playlist.

### 4. You talk about Processors in this plugin several time, what are they?
Well to quote from http://www.navixtreme.com/:
"The purpose of the processor is to function as an online plugin for Navi-X which produces media playback parameters for a single item, 
normally starting with only the URL of the web page which contains the item. In other words, if a web page has a flash player embedded in it, 
the processor teaches Navi-X how to emulate that site's flash player to get the media in the page to play in Showtime."

### 6. What is the status of WatchTV plugin?
With this new plugin, WatchTV plugin became obsoleted, there's no reason to use anymore the system that WatchTV provided, in this plugin you can watch too Live Streams normally and with 
the advantage of viewing those that were added by other users without having work of setting up a server or using a keyboard to enter a link.

### 7. Where can I find facanferff to talk about Showtime?
facanferff is sometimes in Efnet on channel #showtime, you might try to find him there. There will be there some other helpful people ready to assist you.

### 8. How can I give feedback, suggest or report bugs?
To report bugs you can create a ticket in the official bug tracking managed by facanferff and running in andoma's website (http://www.lonelycoder.com/redmine/projects/navix/issues/new).
If the problem is a processor that is throwing any error and if you enabled Report Processors, then it will automatically be reported and you don't need to do anything.
